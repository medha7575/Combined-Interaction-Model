# Combined-Interaction-Model
This file contains the file combined dual material model with Arp 2/3 Actin and Actomyosin interactions corresponding 
to my paper-"Emergence of a smooth interface from growth of a dendritic network against a mechanosensitive contractile material".

This model is similar to the previous individual material models -"Actomyosin-only model" and "Actin-only model" that can be found in the following locations respectively:
https://github.com/medha7575/Actomyosin-Only-Model and
https://github.com/medha7575/Actin-Only-Model

This model uses unique interaction rules designed to mimic the 'in vivo' interaction of actomyosin and Arp 2/3 actin.
